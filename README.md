Log4JNA
=======

Log4jna is a library of native appenders for log4j. Unlike the native implementation(s) in Log4j, this project uses JNA and therefore does not require a native DLL in a system directory or on PATH.

* [org.apache.log4jna.nt.Win32EventLogAppender](org.apache.log4jna.nt.Win32EventLogAppender): a replacement for NTEventLogAppender based on JNA that doesn't require a native DLL in a system directory.
